# Compliance Monitor

A backend service written in Go, that checks financial transactions
for suspicious patterns in real time.

**-- This is a simulation not a certified compliance product, and it doesn't use real sanctions or
watchlist data.**

**Status: runs locally, tested and working. Not yet deployed. Data is
stored in memory only, so it resets when the server restarts.**

## What problem this is based on

Banks and financial companies are required to watch transactions for
money laundering and fraud, and report anything suspicious. This
project is a simplified version of that kind of system. It doesn't 
handle real money or connect to any real bank, but it checks synthetic 
transactions using the same kinds of patterns real systems look for.

## What it does

You send it a transaction (a user ID, an amount, and who they paid).
It checks that transaction against three rules:

- **Structuring** — flags someone making several transactions just
  under a reporting limit, which is a known way people try to avoid
  scrutiny on one big transfer.
- **Velocity anomaly** — flags a transaction that's way bigger than a
  user's normal spending, using basic statistics (standard deviation)
  to spot the outlier.
- **Watchlist** — flags a transaction if the person being paid is on a
  blocklist.

Every check gets logged, whether it flags something or not, so you can
always see why a transaction was or wasn't flagged.

## How it's built

- Transactions come in through an HTTP API and get put in a queue
  instead of being checked immediately, so the API responds fast.
- A set of background workers pulls transactions off the queue and
  runs the checks. Multiple transactions get processed at the same
  time, but transactions from the *same* user are always processed in
  the order they came in (more on why below).
- Data is currently stored in memory (a Go map, till now).

## Run it locally

```bash
go build -o server ./cmd/server
./server
# runs on :8080, or set the PORT environment variable
```

## Try it

```bash
curl localhost:8080/health

curl -X POST localhost:8080/demo/seed

curl localhost:8080/alerts

curl -X POST localhost:8080/transactions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id":"alice","amount":250.00,"currency":"USD","counterparty":"corner-store"}'

curl -X POST localhost:8080/alerts/<alert-id>/resolve

curl localhost:8080/audit/<transaction-id>
```

`/demo/seed` generates fake transactions that are designed to trigger
each of the three rules, so you can see it working without needing
real data.

## Example output

```json
[
  {
    "rule_name": "watchlist",
    "severity": "high",
    "reason": "counterparty \"blocked-entity-1\" matches watchlist"
  },
  {
    "rule_name": "structuring",
    "severity": "high",
    "reason": "4 transactions between 9000.00 and 10000.00 within 72h0m0s (possible structuring)"
  },
  {
    "rule_name": "velocity_anomaly",
    "severity": "medium",
    "reason": "amount 15000.00 is 1182.6 standard deviations above the 8-transaction average of 100.00"
  }
]
```

Also tested by hand: a normal transaction triggers no alerts, and a
transaction sent to a known watchlisted name triggers exactly one.

## API

| Method | Path                      | Description                              |
|--------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/transactions`           | Submit a transaction for checking         |
| GET    | `/alerts?resolved=false`  | List alerts, optionally filtered          |
| POST   | `/alerts/{id}/resolve`    | Mark an alert resolved                    |
| GET    | `/audit/{transactionID}`  | Full history of checks for a transaction  |
| GET    | `/health`                 | Health check + current queue size         |
| POST   | `/demo/seed`              | Generate fake data that triggers each rule|


## Roadmap (to be done)

- Add a real database (Postgres) instead of in-memory storage. The
  storage code is written behind an interface so this should be a
  contained change.
- Maybe a simple dashboard to view alerts without using curl.
